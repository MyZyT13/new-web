Despite spending my career studying computers and related fields, I've discovered a new passion for building things. With no formal training as a carpenter, I've had to learn through trial and error. I'd search online tutorials, make mistakes, and redo things until I got it right. The process has been exhilarating, and the sense of accomplishment I feel when I complete a project is unmatched. I've become surprisingly self-sufficient, tackling projects like building a fishpond, outdoor kitchen, parking space, and even piggery cages. Without needing to hire a carpenter, I've taken on the challenge and learned as I go. It's been a rewarding journey, and I'm proud of what I've created with my own two hands.</p>

Despite the many obstacles and discouragements that come with it, I find myself drawn to the simple yet rewarding process of raising these intelligent and social animals. For now, it's a passion project that allows me to connect with nature and learn new skills. But I envision a future where it becomes a sustainable source of income for me and my family. With every hurdle, I take a deep breath, close my eyes, and press on, fueled by the hope of partial success and the thrill of nurturing life. Even if it starts as just a hobby, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
